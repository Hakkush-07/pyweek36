# PyWeek 36

Topic: **Dark Matter**

Idea: In a 3D space (for 3D pygame, I used my own repo [pygame3D](https://github.com/Hakkush-07/pygame-3D)) full of planets, player travels with a spaceship. However, there exists gravity that scientists can not fully observe due to dark matter that we do not see. In this unpredictable world, can you reach your destination!
